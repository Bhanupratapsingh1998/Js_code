Example for git merge:
Create a new branch and make changes:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature_branch
echo "Some changes" > myfile.txt
git add myfile.txt
git commit -m "Add changes on feature_branch"
Switch to the main branch and make changes:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
echo "Some changes on main" > mainfile.txt
git add mainfile.txt
git commit -m "Add changes on main"
Merge feature_branch into main:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge feature_branch
This creates a new merge commit that combines changes from feature_branch into main.
