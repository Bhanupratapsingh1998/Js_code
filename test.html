Example for git merge:
1.Create a new branch and make changes:
git checkout -b feature_branch
echo "Some changes" > myfile.txt
git add myfile.txt
git commit -m "Add changes on feature_branch"
  
2.Switch to the main branch and make changes:
git checkout main
echo "Some changes on main" > mainfile.txt
git add mainfile.txt
git commit -m "Add changes on main"
 
3.Merge feature_branch into main:
git checkout main
git merge feature_branch

This creates a new merge commit that combines changes from feature branch into main.
